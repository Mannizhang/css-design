<p>A boy went to a shop and bought a pencil and other things. When he was going to pay the bill, he took out his wallet
    and found he had not enough money to pay. He felt awkward. At that moment, an old man who was in charge of the shop
    smiled and said to the boy that he could give the rest of the money next time. The boy was so shocked, as the old
    man trusted him so much. When the boy went home, he remembered it all the time. So the next morning, when he passed
    the shop, he gave the money without hesitation. Integrity is priceless and decides who we are.</p>
