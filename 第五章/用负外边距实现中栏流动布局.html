                    <h1>Angel in my life</h1>
                    <p> I have a good friend, we met each other when I was five years old. She is my neighbor and the
                        first
                        time I saw her, she smiled at me. It was her smile that made me feel she was a nice person to
                        get
                        along with. Indeed, she was a reliable friend. When I was in trouble, she would be the first
                        person
                        to give me a hand. Once I lost my key, when she heard, she tried hard to help me remember where
                        I
                        lost it. I am so lucky to have her as my friend. It is hard to meet someone who can make you
                        feel
                        safe and she is the one. She is the angel in my life.</p>

                    <h1>Sports meeting</h1>
                    <p>Today, my school held a sports meeting. I felt so excited, because I have taken part in many
                        matches. I joined the basketball team. I also raced in 200 and 400 meters matchs. My classmates
                        yelled for me, and I was full of energy. At last, I got the second place in 200 meter race.
                        Whatâ€™s more, our basketball team got the first place. I was so proud of my class.
